During the second year, add ¾ pound of nitrogen fertilizer once in the spring and once in the early summer. After the third year, add about 1 pound of actual nitrogen per year to the mature trees in the spring. To help make the tree hardier, do not fertilize it within 2 months of the first fall frost date or when the fruits are maturing. Be sure to prune the tree to an open center shape. In the summer of the first year, cut the vigorous shoots that form on the top of the tree by two or three buds. After about a month, check the tree. As soon as you have three wide-angled branches, spaced equally apart, cut back any other branches so that these three are the main branches. In the early summer of the second year, cut back the branches in the middle of the tree to short stubs and prune any shoots developing below the three main branches. After the third year, remove any shoots in the center of the tree to keep its shape. Be sure to prune the tree annually to encourage production. Pruning is usually done mid to late April. Pinching the trees in the summer is also helpful. Prune and fertilize to accomplish 10-18 inches of new growth each season. Thin the fruits so that they are 6 to 8 inches apart on the branch after the tree blooms (about 4 to 6 weeks). This ensures that the fruits will be larger. A plastic lean-to can protect fan-trained peach trees from peach leaf curl and frost in the winter. To help increase resistance to fruit diseases, be sure to prune the trees, thin the fruit, and pick the fruit when it is ripe."

Fertilize 3 weeks after transplanting. Lettuce prefers soil that is high in humus, with plenty of compost and a steady supply of nitrogen to keep if growing fast. Use organic alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer. To plant a fall crop, create cool soil in August by moistening the ground and covering it with a bale of straw. A week later, the soil under the bale will be about 10 degrees F (6 degrees C) cooler than the rest of the garden. Sow a three foot row of lettuce seeds every couple of weeks€”just rotate the straw bale around the garden. Make sure soil remains moist but is well-drained. An organic mulch will help conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and keep soil temperatures cool throughout the warmer months. Lettuce will tell you when it needs water. Just look at it. If the leaves are wilting, sprinkle them anytime even in the heat of the day€”to cool them off and slow down the transpiration rate. Weed by hand if necessary, but be careful of plant roots: They are shallow.

A lack of water reduces flower-bud formation. (Keep mulch a few inches away from the trunk.) Fertilize azaleas and rhododendrons sparingly and only when flower buds swell in the early spring, even if they are fall bloomers. Heavy applications of fertilizer will burn the plants. Water plants during the summer if rainfall is less than 1 inch per week. After flowering, deadhead where practical, to promote vegetative growth rather than seed production. Remove dead flowers from rhododendrons carefully; next year's buds are just under the old heads. In regions with severe winters, wrap evergreen rhododendrons with burlap in the fall. Transplant azaleas and rhododendrons whenever the ground is not frozen or waterlogged. Warm-Weather Advisory (Zones 7 to 11) If your weather heats to above 90°F in spring, avoid white-flowered azaleas. Their thin petals shatter in the heat. Plant in a site that receives afternoon shade, especially in hot areas. In tropical zones, azaleas will bloom in full shade. Buy plants in 3-gallon cans rather than 1-gallon cans. They're a better bargain in hot climates. Small plants, with their fewer roots, struggle in the hot late spring and summer. Cold-Zone Reminders (Zones 3 to 6) Plant in full sun to increase flowers and avoid mildew problems. Shrubs need a minimum of 6 hours of full sun daily. Plan on the lee side of a windbreak. If subjected to cold, dry winds, their leaves and buds dry out and die. Do not prune spring-flowering shrubs such as azaleas and rhododendrons. On young and old plants, simply snap off spent flower stalks by bending them over until they break away from their stems. Be careful not to damage growth buds at the base of each flower stalk."

Plum trees are widely adapted, more compact, and require less treatment than most fruit trees. Not only are plums delicious, but the trees themselves add beauty to any garden.",null,"Plum trees can suffer from silver leaf disease, honey fungus, bacterial canker, pocket plum, plum aphids and plum moth.","Thinning plum trees is important to prevent branches breaking under the weight of the trees. If branches do break, prune them back into the undamaged wood, ideally cutting back to a natural fork to avoid leaving stubs. Be sure to water the young trees heavily every week during the first growing season to help promote growth. Then, water regularly. It's best to water the plant deeply at the soil line, then let the soil dry out (though not completely), and then water again. Water your tree well into mid-October to give it plenty of moisture through the winter months. Do not fertilize young fruit trees unti they have set a crop. Once established, fruit production requires regular fertilizing all year long. If there's good fruit set, fertilize with one pound calcium nitrate per tree or 1½ lb. 10-10-10. Cut back the nitrogen in fall and winter to avoid encouraging new growth in those seasons. In the fall, rake away all debris and fallen trees. Prune early spring or mid-summer to avoid infection. The best time for pruning is usually spring for young trees and mid-summer for established ones. Do NOT prune in the fall or winter injury or infection may occur. Did you have any pest issues? Talk to your local extension or garden center about a spray program. To prevent winter injury: Consider a tree wrap or guard around the lower trunk, especially for a young plum tree. Keep an eye on the lower bark and branches for mice or rabbit injury; if this could be a problem, you may need to install tree guards or fence in young trees with chicken wire for the winter. Pruning: Japanese Plum If you have a Japanese type of tree, the best pruning method is to create an open center shape. In the summer of the first year, cut the vigorous shoots that form on the top of the tree by two or three buds. After about a month, check the tree. As soon as you have three wide-angled branches, spaced equally apart, cut back any other branches so that these three are the main branches. In the early summer of the second year, cut back the branches in the middle of the tree to short stubs and prune any shoots developing below the three main branches. After the third year, remove any shoots in the center of the tree to keep its shape. Japanese types require heavy pruning to help keep them in shape and to produce better fruit. It is also good to thin out the fruit on these types of trees. You should space the plums about 3 to 4 inches apart on each branch. Pruning: European Plum If you have a European type of tree, the best pruning method is to create a central leader. This shape features a central trunk with branches that spiral out every 5 to 8 inches, making sure that no branch is directly above another. The training for such a system begins in the early summer of the first year, during which time you should remove any shoots that form within 18 inches of the ground. The end result should resemble a Christmas tree. European types do not require fruit thinning because they do not produce as much fruit as Japanese types. However, the fruit on these types should be spaced about 2 inches apart on each branch. To help control pests and diseases, remember to prune your trees to keep them open. You can also mulch around the trees in the spring to help control weeds, but be sure to remove the mulch in the late fall so that no pests use it over the winter. You can also lightly cultivate the soil around your trees in late spring to eliminate any pests in the soil. "

Pruning Lilacs, Lilacs bloom on old wood, so it's critical to prune in the spring right after they bloom. If you prune later in the summer, you may be removing the wood. Here's a tip: If your lilac flower clusters are getting smaller, time to prune! Every year after bloom, remove any dead wood. Prune out the oldest canes (down to the ground). Remove the small suckers. Cut back weak branches to a strong shoot. Cut back tall canes to eye height. If your lilac is old and in really bad shape, remove one-third of the oldest canes (down to the ground) in year one, half of the remaining old wood in year two, and the rest of the old wood in year three. Another option for old lilacs is to chop the whole thing back to about 6 or 8 inches high. It sounds drastic, but lilacs are very hardy. The downside to this option is that it takes a few years to grow back. The upside is less work and more reward, as the lilac will grow back bursting with blooms.

Water your plants if you receive less than one inch of rain each week. (To know how much rain you are getting, you can place an empty tuna can outside and measure the depth of water with a measuring stick.) Pruning Wisteria Pruning is the secret to good flowering. Prune wisteria in late winter. Remove at least half of the prior year's growth, leaving just a few buds per stem. If you want a more formal appearance, prune again during summer after traditional flowering. For more blooms, try cutting back the rampant shoots every two weeks during the summer. Do you have a new wisteria? Cut the vine back severely right after planting. Then, the next year, cut the main stem or stems back to 3 feet of the previous season's growth. Once the framework is full size, shorten further extension growth in midsummer to where growth began for that season. Informally grown, mature plants need little or no subsequent pruning. For a formally trained plant, cut side shoots back to 6 inches in summer, then shorten them again in winter to 3 buds. Wisteria will resprout with vigor if cut back severely, but this pruning should be avoided, if possible, because new shoots may take some years before they flower."

If at all possible, cover the entire plant, tip included, by making cages out of snow fencing or chicken wire, and loosely filling the cages with leaves. (Do not use maple leaves.). Many of our readers' questions are about pruning a hydrangea. And no wonder it's confusing! It depends on the variety of hydrangea. Common Hydrangea Shrubs The most common garden hydrangea shrub is the Bigleaf variety, H. macrophylla). One type of Bigleaf is the €œMophead€ with the big snowball-size blooms. The other type of Bigleaf is the €œLacecap€ with the pretty flowers almost hanging down from a flat center of tiny blooms. The Bigleaf variety or,H. macrophylla, as well as H. paniculata and H. quercifolia are pruned AFTER the flowers fade. Flower buds actually form in the late summer and flower afterwards the following season, so avoid pruning after August 1.Only cut away dead wood in the fall or very early spring. To prune, cut one or two of the oldest stems down to the base to encourage branching and fullness. If the plant is old or neglected or damaged, prune all the stems down to at the base. You'll lose the flowers for the upcoming season, but also renovate the plant for future years. It's best not to deadhead (remove faded blooms) on the big mopheads; leave them over the winter and cut them back in early spring (to the first healthy pair of buds). It's fine to deadhead the lacecaps; cut down to the second pair of leaves below the flower head. Other Hydrangeas: Oakleaf, panicle, and smooth hydrangeas are treated differently. They blossom on the current seasons' wood. They should be pruned in the later winter when the plant is dormant BEFORE bloom. This means if the buds are killed during the winter, they will produce new buds in the spring which will produce blooms. In general, prune only dead branches, and do not prune to €œshape€ the bush."

The disease known as Blackberry Calico will cause faint yellow blotches on the leaves of the plant.","Trellising and Pruning Trellises should be constructed for blackberries. For trailing varieties, explore a two-wire system, running a top wire at five to six feet with a second line 18 inches below the top wire. After the first year, there will be fruiting floricanes along the wires. Train the new primocanes into a narrow row below the fruiting canes. Directing all canes in one direction may make it simpler. After the fruit harvest period, the old fruiting (floricanes) are removed to the ground. However, unless there is a lot of disease, it's best to delay removing the old fruiting canes until they have died back considerably. This allows the dying canes to move nutrient back into the crown and roots. After old fruiting canes are removed, train the primocanes up on the wires. Work with one or two canes at a time in a spiral around the trellis wires. Canes from adjacent plants may overlap a little. No pruning of primocanes is necessary. In area with low winter temperatures, leave the primocanes on the ground for the winter where they could be mulched for winter protection. In the spring, after damage of extreme cold has passed, train the old primocanes (now floricanes) up on the wires. Avoid working with the canes in cold weather, as they are more prone to breaking. Erect blackberries produce stiff, shorter canes that come from the crown and root suckering (forming a hedgerow). A T-trellis works well to support erect blackberries. Erect blackberries require summer pruning. Remove the top one to two inches of new primocanes when they are four feet tall. This causes the canes to branch, increasing next year's yields. This will require several pruning sessions to tip each cane as it reaches the four foot height. Primocanes (suckers) that grow outside the hedgerow should be regularly removed. In the winter, remove the dead floricanes (old fruiting canes) from the hedgerow. Also shorten the lateral branches to about 1½ to 2½ feet. With primocane-fruiting erect blackberries, cut all canes off just above the ground in the late winter for the best fruit. In the summer, when the primocanes are 3½ feet tall, removed the top 6 inches. The primocanes will branch, thereby producing larger yields in the fall. Semi-erect blackberries are vigorous and easier to manage on a Double T Trellis. Install four-foot cross arms at the top of a six foot post. Install a three-foot cross arm about two-feet below the top line. String high-tensile wire down the rows, connecting to the cross arms. These berries need to be pruned in the summer. When the primocanes are five feet tall, remove the top two inches to encourage branching. This will require several pruning sessions to prune canes as they reach the height. In the winter, remove the dead floricanes (old fruiting canes). Spread the primocanes (new floricanes) out along the trellis. Canes do not need to be shortened. However, they can be if they are difficult to train. Mulching is important throughout the season to conserve moisture and suffocate weeds. Keep a thick layer of mulch surrounding plants at all times. Water one inch per week. The roots may keep sending up an abundant amount of shoots (canes). Keep order by pruning away the majority of them so that the survivors can produce lots of berries."

If the tree grows more than 12 inches in one season, use less fertilizer the next year. Be very careful when applying fertilizer! If you give your trees too much nitrogen, they will become more susceptible to fire blight. For dwarf trees, prune them to a central leader system. Standard-size trees can be pruned to either a central leader system or a modified leader system, which is easier to maintain. The central leader system features a central trunk with branches that spiral out every 5 to 8 inches, making sure that no branch is directly above another. The training for such a system begins in the early summer of the first year, during which time you should remove any shoots that form within 18 inches of the ground. The end result should resemble a Christmas tree. Use spreaders to help shape the branches of the trees. These help the branches to spread outward rather than upward.

A pH of 6.5 is just about right for most home gardens (slightly acidic to neutral).,Good gardening practices such as removing dead leaves and canes will help reduce pests. Find out which pests are most prevalent in your area by checking with your local nursery. Here are some of the more common problems:,"Watering Roses Diligently water your roses. Soak the entire root zone at least twice a week in dry summer weather. Avoid frequent shallow sprinklings, which won't reach the deeper roots and may encourage fungus. Roses do best with 90 inches of rain per year, so unless you live in a rain forest, water regularly. Roses love water€”but don't drown them. That is, they don't like to sit in water, and they'll die if the soil is too wet in winter. The ideal soil is rich and loose, with good drainage. One of the worst mistakes you can make is to not provide adequate drainage. Use mulch. To help conserve water, reduce stress, and encourage healthy growth, apply a 2- to 4-inch layer of chopped and shredded leaves, grass clippings, or shredded bark around the base of your roses. Allow about an inch of space between the mulch and the base stem of the plant. Feeding Roses Feed roses on a regular basis before and throughout the blooming cycle (avoid chemical fertilizers and pesticides if you're harvesting for the kitchen). Once a month between April and July, apply a balanced granular fertilizer (5-10-5 or 5-10-10). Allow ¾ to 1 cup for each bush, and sprinkle it around the drip line, not against the stem. In May and June, scratch in an additional tablespoon of Epsom salts along with your fertilizer; the magnesium sulfate will encourage new growth from the bottom of the bush. Pruning Roses Prune roses every spring and destroy all old or diseased plant material. Wear elbow-length gloves that are thick enough to protect your hands from thorns or a clumsy slip, but flexible enough to allow you to hold your tools. Always wear safety goggles; branches can whip back when released. Start with pruning shears for smaller growth. Use loppers, which look like giant, long-handle shears, for growth that is more than half an inch thick. A small pruning saw is handy, as it cuts on both the push and the pull. Deadhead religiously and keep beds clean. Every leaf has a growth bud, so removing old flower blossoms encourages the plant to make more flowers instead of using the energy to make seeds. Clean away from around the base of the rosebushes any trimmed debris that can harbor disease and insects. Late in the season, stop deadheading rugosas so that hips will form on the plants; these can be harvested and dried on screens, away from sunlight, then stored in an airtight container. Stop deadheading all your rose plants 3 to 4 weeks before the first hard frost so as not to encourage new growth at a time when new shoots may be damaged by the cold. Winterizing Roses Do not prune roses in the fall. Simply cut off any dead or diseased canes. Stop fertilizing 6 weeks before the first frost but continue watering during dry autumn weather to help keep plants fortified during the dry winter. Mound, mulch, or add compost after a few frosts but before the ground freezes. Where temperatures stay below freezing during winter, enclose the plant with a sturdy mesh cylinder, filling the enclosure with compost, mulch, dry wood chips, pine needles, or chopped leaves. Don't use heavy, wet, maple leaves for mulch. Mulch instead with oak leaves, pine needles, compost, or straw. Clean up the rose beds to prevent overwintering of diseases. One last spray for fungus with a dormant spray is a good idea."

Keep a thick layer of mulch surrounding plants at all times. Water one inch per week. The roots send up an abundant amount of shoots, called canes. Keep order by pruning away the majority of them so that the survivors can produce lots of berries. Pruning Summer-Bearers produce berries on two year old canes while one year old canes grow right beside them. You shouldn't have trouble telling which is which: the older canes have brown stems, and the young ones are still green. Prune only the older ones, the ones that have finished their fruitful year. Prune in the fall. Leave about 6 of the thickest, strongest green canes. Keep plant contained to a 19-inch wide space. Left alone without care all summer, neat rows will become thickets. Cut off all canes that grow sideways. Ever-Bearers require less care: Mow them to the ground in the fall, after you finish picking. (For a small patch, pruning shears will do.)

There are several techniques to direct growth without heavy pruning. For example:Rub off misplaced buds before they grow into misplaced branches.Bend a stem down almost horizontally for a few weeks to slow growth and promote branches and fruiting. Tie down with strings to stakes in the ground or to lower branches.Prune a Mature Tree AnnuallyOnce an apple tree has filled in and is bearing fruit, it requires regular, moderate pruning.Prune your mature tree when it is dormant. Completely cut away overly vigorous, upright stems (most common high up in the tree).Remove weak twigs (which often hang from the undersides of limbs.Shorten stems that become too droopy, especially those low in the tree.After about ten years, fruiting spurs (stubby branches that elongate only about a half-inch per year) become overcrowded and decrepit. Cut away some of them and shorten others.When a whole limb of fruiting spurs declines with age, cut it back to make room for a younger replacement.Thin RuthlesslyThin or remove excess fruit. This seems hard but this practice evens out production, prevents a heavy crop from breaking limbs, and ensures better-tasting, larger fruit crop.Soon after fruit-set, remove the smallest fruits or damaged ones,leaving four inches between those that remain."

It is very susceptible to frost and heat damage, but with proper care it will produce a bumper crop with very few plants.",null,Squash Bug (link to pest page),"Mulch plants to protect shallow roots, discourage weeds, and retain moisture. When the first blooms appear, apply a small amount of fertilizer as a side dress application. For all type of squash, frequent and consistent watering is recommended. Water most diligently when fruits form and throughout their growth period. Water deeply once a week, applying at least one inch of water. Do not water shallowly; the soil needs to be moist 4 inches down. After harvest begins, fertilize occasionally for vigorous growth and lots of fruits. If your fruits are misshapen, they might not have received enough water or fertilization."
