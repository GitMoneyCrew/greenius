Greenius is a fullstack web application helping individuals plant and manage their gardens. It allows gardeners of all levels to more easily grow their own flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Greenius will help gardeners learn more about where to plant, when to water and how to grow and harvest healthier fruits and vegetables. Greenius was developed over the course of three weeks and successfully delivers the following features:

1. Signup/Login with Google authentication, implemented with Auth0 to provide client-side and server-side (API) authentication.
2. Browse from over 100 commonly chosen plant species and view critical information for growing healthy plants. Species data scraped from (http://www.almanac.com/).
3. Add plants to the 'Nursery' sandbox by entering a plant nickname and clicking 'Add Plant'.
4. View all your plants from the 'My Plants' page and find additional species information by clicking on a specific plant.
5. Create separate gardens with our simple garden builder, utilizing angular-drag-and-drop library.
6. Plant and set watering schedule by drag and dropping a plant from the nursery sandbox into one of the garden sandboxes. 
7. Watering events scheduling is automatically generated by using the moments.js library.
8. View watering 'Events' calendar from the 'Dashboard' page, allowing for weekly and/or monthly watering schedule visua. Events calendar was implemented with AngularUI calendar library.
9. Email notifications reminding garden enthusiasts of upcoming watering events was implemented with Nodemailer, an e-mail sending module for Node.js.
10. An SQL database was architected using SQLite.
11. A testing suite with over 50 tests for various functionality was built, utilizing Karma for frontend unit-testing and jasmine for backend unit-testing.

All of these features makes it incredibly easy to research, organize, and manage gardens. Take a look at the code base and become a contributor!
